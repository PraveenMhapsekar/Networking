#1 Addressing
	- Global Unicast
		- Publically routable IP
    - 2000::/3
	- Link Local (Non routed address)
		- immediately connected host 
		- Used to communicate between devices on same n/w segment FE80::/10
	- Unique Local 
		- Private IP
		- FD00::/8
#2 Multicast
	- FF00::/8
	- FF02::1 - All hosts on n/w segment
  - FF02::2 - All routers on n/w segment
#3 Anycast Address
	- Same as multicast, one address for many interfaces, but packet is delived to only on host among many interfaces

#4 ICMPv6
  - Router Solicitation (RS)
  - Router Advertisment (RA)
  - Neighbour Sol
  - Neighbour Adv
  - Redirect
#5 IPv6 Autoconfigured
  - Statefull
		- Maunally
		- DHCP
	- Statless (SLAAC - StateLess Address Auto Configuration)	
		- Link Local Address 
			- only to communicate with local connected i/f
      - starts with FE80::/10
			- Derived from MAC address or randomly generated.
		- Check LinkLocal Address for uniqueness
		- After above check LinkLocal Address become "preferred"
		- Send Router Solicitation (RS) using Link Local Address as source address to all routers (FF02::2)
    - Router will responde with Router Advertisement (RA) message, which will contain
      - Default gateway
      - Network ID
      - Method to get address (DHCP or non DHCP etc)
    - Combination of Network Id and Link Local address is used to configure i/f address.
