SOURCE TREE:
path from a multicast source (the root of the tree) through the network to the receivers in the multicast group. The source tree is the shortest path that a multicast packet can take from source to receiver, so it is also known as the shortest-path tree (SPT). The sender and receiver are annotated as a source and multicast group pair, shortened to (S, G); for example, (192.168.1.1, 225.9.2.6). The following figure illustrates three shortest-path trees from the source to three receivers.

SHARED TREE:
	 path rooted at the RP, not at the multicast source. A shared tree is also known as an RP tree or RPT. Routers forward multicast packets from various sources to the RP and the RP forwards the packets down the shared tree. A shared tree is annotated as (*, G), using a wildcard as the source because all sources belonging to the multicast group share the same distribution tree from the RP. An example shared tree annotation is (*, 226.3.1.5). The following figure illustrates a shared tree from the root at the RP to the receivers.

REVERSE PATH FORWARDING:
	PIM uses reverse-path forwarding (RPF) to prevent multicast routing loops by leveraging the unicast routing table on the virtual router. When the virtual router receives a multicast packet, it looks up the source of the multicast packet in its unicast routing table to see if the outgoing interface associated with that source IP address is the interface on which that packet arrived. If the interfaces match, the virtual router duplicates the packet and forwards it out the interfaces toward the multicast receivers in the group. If the interfaces donâ€™t match, the virtual router drops the packet. The unicast routing table is based on the underlying static routes or the interior gateway protocol (IGP) your network uses, such as OSPF.
