#1 AS (Autonomous System) 
   - Collection of same routers under same administrative domain.
   - Communication between same AS uses IGP protocols
     - RIP
     - IGRP
     - EGRP
     - OSPF
	- To communicate between AS use EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)
		- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

#2 IGP Routing
	- Static Routing
	- Default Routing
  - Dynamic Routing
		RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, ISIS

#3 BGP Features
	- Standard Protocol
	- Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)
	- Designed for inter-AS domain routing.
  - Designed to scale large inter-networking.
  - Path Vector protocol
		- AS path information is propogated across AS
  - Need to configure neighbours manually
  - BGP uses TCP reliability (TCP port #179)

#4 BGP Loop Prevention Mechanism
	- If router sses its own AS number in path-information, router will not accept that route.

#5 When to use BGP ?
	- AS is working as transit AS
	- AS is connected to multiple AS

#6 When not to use BGP?
	- if it is single homed AS
	- Lack of resources in router to maintain BGP information
	- Limited understaning of BGP rte filtering and path selection process.

#7 Types of ISP connections.
	1. Single Home Connection
		- Single exit point
		- Static routing
	2. Dual homed connection
		- Primary/Backup site connectivity to same AS
		- Load balancing
		- Either Static of dynamic routing would work
	3. Multihoming
		- Connecting to more than one ISP.
		- ISP level redundancy.
	4. Dual Multihomed
		- Multi-AS connectivity with multiple connectivity to each AS

#8 BGP Neighbours
	- TCP connection to established to neighbour
	- BGP Neighbours are also called "BGP Peers"
	- BGP Neighbours are manually configured
	- IBGP : All routers are in same AS
	- EBGP : External BGP neighbours, Different AS
